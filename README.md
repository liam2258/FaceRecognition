See it live here (https://liam2258.github.io/FaceRecognition/)

And the back end API here (https://github.com/liam2258/FaceRecognitionApi)

The front end of a web app made with React that can locate the location of a face when given an image url. It has a functioning registration and will track the amount of times the app is used to detect faces for each account. Communicates with a back-end server written in NodeJS using HTTP and JSON.
